Repository for sharing code snippets we find handy and useful. 

### We recommend you to use [ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin](https://github.com/acoomans/ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin)

ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin is a plugin for Xcode that syncs your code snippets with any repository, so you don't need to copy files: just push them to the repo, and they will appear in Xcode.
